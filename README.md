Our main goal is to build a classification model that most accurately predicts the price range of mobile phones. We do so by using phone_train to train our classification models, choosing the model with highest accuracy via cross validation, and applying the final model to the test set  

Given that our response variable is categorical with more than 2 levels
and our predictors are a mix of binary and continuous predictors, we will consider using classication models
like Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes.
